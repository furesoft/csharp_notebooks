= Introduction

Strings in C\# are objects that represent sequences of characters. They are immutable, meaning once created, their contents cannot be changed. C\# provides a rich set of methods and properties for working with strings efficiently.

== Declaration and Initialization

== Creating Strings
You can create strings in several ways:

```csharp
// Using string literals
string greeting = "Hello, World!";

// Using string concatenation
string fullName = "John" + " " + "Doe";

// Using string interpolation (C# 6.0+)
string message = $"Welcome, {fullName}!";
```

== String Properties and Methods
C\# strings come with useful properties and methods:

```csharp
string text = "Example Text";

int length = text.Length; // Returns 12

string upper = text.ToUpper(); // Returns "EXAMPLE TEXT"
string lower = text.ToLower(); // Returns "example text"

bool contains = text.Contains("amp"); // Returns true
string trimmed = "  Hello  ".Trim(); // Returns "Hello"

int index = trimmed.IndexOf('e'); // Returns 1
```

Strings are kind of special. They hold an array of chars internally. You can access characters by its 0-based index:
```csharp
var str = "hello";
int index = str[0]; // Returns 'h'
```

== String Manipulation
You can manipulate strings using various methods:
```csharp
string original = "Hello, World!";

string substring = original.Substring(0, 5); // Returns "Hello"
string replaced = original.Replace("World", "C#"); // Returns "Hello, C#!"
string[] split = original.Split(','); // Returns ["Hello", " World!"]
```

Remember that string operations that appear to modify a string actually create a new string object.

= Exercises

The amount of ðŸŒ¶ determines how hard the excercises are.

1. Create a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the number of words in it. Assume words are separated by spaces. Print the total word count. ðŸŒ¶

2. Create a program that takes an input and prints the string character by character in reversed order in new lines. ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶

3. Caesar chiffre: Write a program that can print a string as caesar encrypted value. The user enters a number as encryption key and the program displays every character shifted by that key in the alphabet. You can ignore the casing. ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ 

   #underline[Samples:]\
   ```
   Input: Hello
   Key: 7
   Output: olssv

   Input: The zoo is big
   Key: 3
   Output: Wkh crr lv elj
   ```

4. Do the same as in 3. but decode the chiffre. ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶
