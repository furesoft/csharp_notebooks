== Strings in C\# Part 2

In this section, we will explore escape sequences and raw strings in C\#.

== Escape Sequences

Escape sequences are used to represent special characters within string literals. They are prefixed with a backslash (`\`). Here are some common escape sequences:

- `\n` : Newline
- `\t` : Tab
- `\\` : Backslash
- `\"` : Double quote
- `\'` : Single quote

== Raw Strings

Raw Strings allow you to create string literals without needing to escape special characters. In C\#, raw strings are enclosed in triple double quotes (`"""`). This is particularly useful for strings that contain many special characters or span multiple lines.

Example of a raw string:
```csharp
string rawString = """
    This is a raw string.
    It can span multiple lines
    and contain "special characters" without escaping.
    """;
```
