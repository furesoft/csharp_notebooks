= Task 1: Number Guessing Game
Write a program where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100.
The program should generate a random number and give hints if the guessed number is too high or too low.

= Task 2: Age in Days
Write a program that asks the user for their age in years and calculates their approximate age in days.
(Assume a year has 365 days; ignore leap years.)

= Task 3 (New): Vowel Counter
Write a program that asks the user to input a sentence.
The program should count and display the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the sentence.

= Task 4: Multiplication Table
Let the user enter a number, and then print the multiplication table for that number up to 10.
Example: For input 5, the output should include 5 x 1 = 5, 5 x 2 = 10, etc.

= Task 5: Palindrome Checker
Write a program that checks if a given word is a palindrome (e.g., "radar" or "level").
Use methods like Reverse on the string to perform the check.

= Task 6: Shopping List
Create a program to manage a simple shopping list:
The user can add items to the list.
Display the list after each addition.
Allow the user to save the list to a file.

= Task 7: Sort Numbers
Let the user input a list of numbers separated by commas (e.g., 5,2,8,1).
Sort the numbers and display them in ascending order.

= Task 8: Password Generator
Write a program to generate a random password with a user-specified length.
The password should include letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters.

= Task 9 (New): FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

= Task 10 (New): Fibonacci Sequence
Ask the user to input a number n.
The program should calculate and display the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
(The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous ones.)
